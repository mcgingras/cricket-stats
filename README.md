# CRICKET
---

practicing react/redux/PWA with a cricket app.
what other PWA standards do I need to incorporate?

TODO:
stats
P2P scoring...? (just need to call firebase in action creator... can have one db for a single game that just gets sweeped out each time )
refactor redux? (read about better practices first)
CSS.js (inline css for each component)
rankings?
CSS Modules


complicated pieces ->
how to properly structure data
how to network with firebase and redux
